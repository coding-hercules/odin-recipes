    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Learn how to make Seared Scallops with a perfectly golden brown crust, 
            just like at the restaurants! They are incredibly simple to make at 
            home and much cheaper than dining out.</p>

        <p> Their mildly sweet flavor and that caramelized crust they get when 
            seared in a super hot panâ€¦oh, swoon. Not to mention, they are really 
            low-maintenance compared to lobster and crab.</p>
